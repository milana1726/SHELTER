                <h3>About the shelter “Cozy House”</h3>
                <p>Currently we have 121 dogs and 
                    342 cats on our hands and statistics show that only 
                    20% of them will find a family. The others will continue 
                    to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky chance to 
                    become dearly loved.</p>
                <p>We feed our wards with the best 
                    food and make sure that they do not get sick, feel 
                    comfortable (including psychologically) and well. 
                    We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees 
                    of various skill levels. About 12% of the animals 
                    are taken by the shelter staff. Taking care of the 
                    animals, they become attached to the pets and would 
                    hardly ever leave them alone.</p>
